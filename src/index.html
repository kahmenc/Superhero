    <p>A superbad superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.</p>

    <p>By most definitions, <span><a href="http://google.com">characters</a></span> do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed <em>superheroes</em>.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero " is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime ",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary
        gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful
        or successful person ".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes
        used to refer to <span> such as t</span>he Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as <em>superheroes</em> but nevertheless
        share similar traits.</p>

    <p>Some <em>superheroes</em> use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
        who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
        Some long-running <em>superheroes</em> such as <b>Batman</b>, Spider-Man, superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the
        Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>

    <h3 id="#section-history">History</h3>

    <h5 id="#section-common">Early history</h5>

    <p>The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
        who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
        of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp
        fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began
        appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character
        Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]</p>

    <p>In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10]
        (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13]
        (1934), superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.</p>

    <h5 id="#section-19">1940s</h5>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many <em>superheroes</em>: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient
        Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil;
        she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg ".[14][15]
        The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower
        of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months
        later on June 3, 1940.[16]</p>

    <p>One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary
        of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely
        Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime-fighters during this era
        lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,[17][18] introduced in Standard Comics' Thrilling
        Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert The Spirit Section June 2,
        1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, <br/><br/> debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury,[19]
        debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced
        in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced in Harvey Comics' Pocket Comics
        #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character.[22]
        The most iconic comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman.[23] Modeled from the
        myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration
        from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.[24][25] Wonder Woman's first appearance was in All Star
        Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics
        in 1944.</p>

    <h3 id="section-common">Common traits</h3>
    <p>Many superhero characters display the following traits:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Extraordinary powers or abilities. superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced
                senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like <b>Batman</b>, Mockingbird, the
                Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage
                techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons
                or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed
                by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon
                or device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating
                hammer, and Wolverine's adamantium claws).</li>
            <li>A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation
                of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.</li>
